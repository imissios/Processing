bubbleGame contains Bubble! (2022)

Bubble! is a simple point-and-click game with easy and hard modes. The goal is to pop 10 bubbles before they reach the surface by lining up the cursor's circle with the rising bubbles. The mouse's location controls the circle's location, while pressing the mouse helps to control the circle's size.

agriculturalSimulator contains Agricultural Development: The Human Advantage in Ecological Competition (2023)

Agricultural Development: The Human Advantage in Ecological Competition (2023) is a gamified ecosystem simulation made using Processing code. It allows the user to explore how agricultural development can unintentionally impact natural animal ecosystems. The users’ actions represent those of a developing human settlement on the land, while the wild animals are completely computer-driven. The simulation is intended to pose questions about how humans impact and interact with preexisting ecological systems, while giving weight to the fact that we are also just trying to survive. This is emphasized through the “game” aspect of the simulation, which requires the player to maintain the health of the human population even if it means restricting the land use by the wild animals or by culling problem animals.
